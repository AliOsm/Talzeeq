[`PyQt5`](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5) based desktop application to build Deep Learning models in a drag-and-drop environment.

This project is heavily based on the `Diagram Scene Example` provided by [Qt Documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5).
The example is available in both [C++](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwidgets-graphicsview-diagramscene-example.html) and [Python](https://github.com/baoboa/pyqt5/tree/master/examples/graphicsview/diagramscene) languages.

## Development

- Install Python version `3.8.5` (This is the only version I tested the project on until now).
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run `python src/app.py`.
- Have fun!
